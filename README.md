# SimpleDesktop
A Simple Java Swing App for doing things with.

I needed a simple example of a desktop application written in Java for tesing purposes. I looked for one, and being unable to find one that would suit my needs, I created one.

The application contains a few simple items:
* It has a Panel to put things into.
* It has a Label.
* It has a Button that does something.
* It has a TextBox.
